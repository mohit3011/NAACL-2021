virus-with-liberal-idiots/
Perspective API toxicity score: 0.7162694


Excerpts:


"It is futile to debate anything with idiots, but they are fun to engage. So I’m
back because ‘liberal’ idiots are back. These days they are busy washing
away thook stains of Tablighi Jamaat."


"You keep shouting “test test test” so go and test those Hindus who attended
any event that you claim. Go on and prove your claim. And mind you, when
you trace these people and go to test them, they will not throw stones at
police, they will not break head of doctor, and they will not spit at nurses."


● Even news reports reflect toxicity sometimes, when they are not written with a
factual tone:
eg.

-coronavirus-corona-warriors/
Perspective API toxicity score: 0.60453844


Excerpts:


"However, if the gathering itself was irresponsible borne of a toxic mix of
ignorance, stupidity, and callousness, the conduct of some of the Jamaatis
that followed could only be attributed to their perversity. Some were also
involved in attacking health workers, making bizarre demands and spitting on
doctors."
